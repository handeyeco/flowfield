# Flow Field

Perlin/Simplex noise flow field in Canvas

A recreation of Andy Saia's work with flow fields using JavaScript/Canvas instead of ActionScript/Flash.

See the examples:

For Andy Saia's excellent article on flow fields: http://www.andysaia.com/radicalpropositions/perlin-noise-flow-fields/

Couldn't have been done without the speed optimized Simplex Noise by Jonas Wagner:
https://github.com/jwagner/simplex-noise.js

I welcome PRs that get these examples closer to the ones on Andy Saia's blog.
